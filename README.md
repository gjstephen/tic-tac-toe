# :page_facing_up: About
How to play:
- naughts always goes first
- click on whichever grid box you would like for your move
- you cannot claim a box that your opponent already has
- you will win if you have 3 tiles in a row

- to play another round, hit the 'Next Round' button
- to reset the game, hit the 'New Game' button
- You can customize your player name if you wish

# :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- I started by roughly drawing up the page layout 
- Then I design the game logic, by running through what a turn looks like
- The page was built in the order of the game logic

# :rocket: Cool Tech
- HTML, CSS, JS
- DOM manipulation to alter web page
- overlay allowing the ability to switch themes

# :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- the page needs to be refreshed before swapping themes, otherwise they mix together

# :sob: Lessons learnt
What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...

# :white_check_mark: Future features
- I would like to add more themes
- Fix the ability to swap themes without needing to refresh the webpage
- add media queries to reformat the page on different browser sizes
- add audio clips to play on rounds run
- perhaps add some transitions/animations
- add lines to show how a player won
- swap starting player between each round
